This project is to practice HTML skills.It contains```<h1> ~ <h3>, <p>, <a>, <br>, <hr>, <ul> ```and `<ol>`tags.Besides the mentioned skills,  I gave some links a `<h3>`tag to make the word bigger than plained `<a>`.
But I know if I want to make words bigger should use CSS to adjust the size of the word, and I should not use `<br>`between the lists.
Anyway, I still gained a little confidence after finishing this practice project. (^-^)
Thank you, The Odin Project.
