This project is to practice HTML skills.It contains <h1> ~ <h3>, <p>, <a>, <br>, <hr>, <ul> and <ol> tags.
Besides the mentioned skills,  I gave some links a <h3> tag to make the word bigger than plained <a>. But I know if I want to make words bigger should use CSS to adjust the size of the word.
I gained a little confidence after finishing this practice project. (^-^)
Thank you, The Odin Project.
