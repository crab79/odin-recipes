        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>DIt may take a few hours to make this famous Scottish soup but there's really not much to it other than some chopping and simmering. It's one of the world's best chicken soups! Top with freshly ground black pepper and chopped fresh chives.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds leeks</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 large bay leaf</li>
            <br>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, halved</li>
            <br>
            <li>4 medium pitted prunes</li>
            <br>
            <li>3 quarts cold water, or more as needed</li>
            <br>
            <li>¼ cup uncooked white rice</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <br>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut off the leek tops (the dark green, fibrous parts) and wash well. Set aside the leek bottoms.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Put clean leak tops in the bottom of a large pot. Place chicken on top and add bay leaf, garlic, dried plums, and 3 quarts water. Set over high heat until it starts to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low or low and simmer gently, occasionally pushing the chicken under the liquid with tongs, for 1 hour 15 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare leek bottoms by trimming off the root ends and slicing them in half lengthwise. Turn leeks and cut crosswise into ½-inch slices. Transfer to a large bowl and fill with cold water so leeks are floating. Toss with your hands to loosen dirt. Grab leeks with your hands, shake gently to remove water, and transfer to another bowl. Place in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Carefully lift chicken with two forks, let liquid drain from the cavity, and place it in a bowl. Separate meat from skin and bones. Tear meat into bite-sized pieces put in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place skin and bones back into the pot and gently simmer for 1 more hour.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Set a colander in a bowl. Use a skimmer spoon to transfer all solids from the broth to the colander. Discard solids and transfer any broth back to the pot.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add half of the sliced leeks to the pot with salt, pepper, and rice. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, skimming some fat off if you want and adding more water if it's reducing down too much.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add remaining sliced leeks, chicken, and thyme. Simmer over medium-low for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
